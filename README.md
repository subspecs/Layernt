# Layernt
A multiplatform application that can hide files inside images by encoding them straight into the pixels themselves rather than using any meta data at all.<br>
In short, it is basically physically impossible to tell a difference between an noisy image or an encrypted(needs a password) image.<br>
Makes hiding stuff very safe! Good luck to **FBI**/**CIA**. ^^<br>

The encoded images appear completely normal from the surface, and since no meta data is being used they can be uploaded to any* image host and you can essentially host files online for free.<br>
Or you can use **Layernt** to store your secret porn stash on your phones image gallery by encrypting the images there.<br>
Seriously, the possibilites are endless, you could even have secret meme communications this way.<br>
<sub>* - Some image hosts do re-encode their images, which will corrupt your data in them. Ex: On Imgur, they start re-encoding/resizing images when they are above 5mb if you are a member.</sub>
### Spread the word people! Lets take back our privacy!<br>


**Layernt** uses [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) for image saving on all platforms, so on platfroms you can get ImageSharp working, **Layernt** will also work on them.<br>
They also use a completely different license than us, so **if** you need a commercial license then firstly rent a copy from them, then contact us (subspecs@gmail.com) for further discussion to receive an closed source / commercial license.<br>
#### For everyone else, enjoy!<br>
P.S: If you'd help me pay off the [physiatrist](https://www.patreon.com/subspecs) that's helping me do all this, then I'd appreciate it!

If it complains about the ".NET 7 is not installed", then head over to [microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) and download it. (Might need a PC restart, probably not tho.)<br>
